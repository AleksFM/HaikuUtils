TraverseApps2

Utility that display windows and views in a tree. It allows to pick view by pressing target icon at tool bar. view tree information is retrieved by scripting. Window visibility and z-order is not handled correctly for now. Tree is not updated automatically, using "Edit" -> "Update" is required to update.

Currently only GCC4+ is supported. For 32 bit Haiku use `setarch x86`.
